* Notes:
* 1. Element in a `whole` class occupies the entire width.
* 2. Element in a `half` class occupies half the width.
* 3. A `half` has to be placed inside a `whole`.
* 4. A `whole` can contain two `half`s.
* 5. A `padded-half` provides some padding towards the center.
* 6. Use two `padded-half`s to have a gutter in the center.
* 7. There is no parent "grid container".
*
* TODO: 
* 1. Extract Percentages as a Math Calculation.
* 2. Make grid availabe as mixins to avoid html pollution.
